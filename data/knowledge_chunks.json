        "text": "Newton's First Law states that an object remains at rest or continues to move at a constant velocity in a straight line unless acted upon by an external force. This tendency of objects to resist changes in their state of motion is called inertia. For example, a book lying on a table remains at rest until someone pushes it."

        "text": "Newton's Second Law explains how the motion of an object changes when a force is applied. It states that the acceleration of an object is directly proportional to the force applied and inversely proportional to its mass. This relationship is commonly written as F = m × a."

        "difficulty": "beginner",
        "text": "Newton's Third Law states that for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. This means that forces in nature come in pairs. For example, when you push against a wall, the wall pushes back against you with an equal force."
